You are given string whose digits can form additive sequence.
A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.
Given a string containing only digits '0'-'9', write a function to determine if it's an additive number.
Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid
